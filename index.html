    On the sacred occasion of Shivaji Jayanti, we proudly celebrate the birth anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj, the great warrior king and founder of the Maratha Empire. Born in 1630 at Shivneri Fort, he dedicated his life to establishing Swarajya (self-rule) and protecting his people from injustice. With his brilliant military strategies, strong navy, and well-organized administration, he built a powerful and independent kingdom.
    Shivaji Maharaj was not only a fearless fighter but also a just and kind ruler. He respected women, promoted religious harmony, and ensured fair justice for all. His leadership, vision, and patriotism continue to inspire millions across India. On Shivaji Jayanti, we remember his sacrifices, honor his greatness, and take inspiration from his courage, discipline, and love for the motherland.
